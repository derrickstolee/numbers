Contributing to the Small Numbers Project
=========================================

Thank you for your interest in the Small Numbers Project!

Goals
-----

* Reproduce computations of extremal functions on small values.

* Provide many approaches for mathematicians to approach
  computing extremal functions.

* Extend human knowledge by collating and extending known values
  of extremal functions.

How Can You Help?
-----------------

* **Suggest future directions:** If there is a topic you think is
  of interest to the project, then please create an Issue describing
  the topic. Please include citations to known work on the subject.

* **Contribute Code:** We are always trying to improve our algorithms
  so we can efficiently reproduce known values of these functions. We
  do not expect to match the best results in the world, but we can get
  as close as possible by improving our algorithms. Also, the way we
  approach the problem may inspire others to get started in their own
  research.

* **Contribute Writing:** There are several areas where we can expand
  the description of the problems and the existing literature. We can
  create surveys of existing approaches and algorithms. We could use
  better data collation: How can we best communicate what is known?
  How can we best communicate extremal examples?

* **Contribute Computation:** Most of these problems have exponential
  complexity, so we are limited in our ability to compute the values.
  Some times we just need to leave a process running for a very long
  time. Other times, we want to run several processes in parallel.
  Other times, we need large amounts of memory. If you have access to
  machines and want to contribute computation, please do!

How To _Actually_ Contribute
----------------------------

After you decide how you want to help, please fork the repo, make your
changes in your fork, and open a pull request.

If you don't know how these things work, then please contact the
organizer for help. We understand that this fork-based workflow is
probably foreign to mathematicians and those who do not develop
software for a living. We are willing to work with you to get you
started!
